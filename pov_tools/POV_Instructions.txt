# EZ-POV 
Use ProffieOS POV Tools to create Point-Of-View images that show when you swing the blade.  
Under the hood:  
pnmtorle - Converts a full-color image to hex data to be included in the code.  
pgmtorle - Converts a single-color image to hex data to be included in the code.  
pnmwindshieldwiper - Scales the image and bends it so that it will work on a swinging blade.  

### Operating System Requirements:  
### Windows (Windows 10 at time of writing):  

Install Windows Subsystem for Linux  
- Get Ubuntu App in the Microsoft Store. (required for “bash” and other commands). Download but don't choose open once it finishes installing. 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
- Type “Turn Windows features on or off” into the Windows search, open the top result, scroll down and enable "Windows Subsystem for Linux".
- Click "OK", then click "Reboot Now". 
- Open the Ubuntu app and wait while it says "Installing, this may take a few minutes...".
- Choose a username and password. Once you get a green prompt (should be username+computername), close the window.
- Type “WSL” into the windows search and click that cheeky penguin image.  

Install g++ and netpbm
- It goes without saying that you hit the return key after each of the following entries.
- In the command line window that opened, type "sudo apt-get update". Enter your password.
- When that finishes, type "sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb".
- Answer the question with "y".
- When that finishes, type "sudo apt install netpbm".
- Answer the question with "y".

### MacOS:
- Install Homebrew https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/homebrew
- Install netpbm (In Terminal, type "brew install netpbm").  

### Linux
- Install netpbm http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/

### Make POV files

- Put a .png image you want to convert into the pov_tools folder. (Simple, single color images work best at the moment)  
If there are any spaces in your filenames, the script will change them to underscores for you before processing.
If you have no images but want to try the sample Star Wars logo .png, run the script anyway and it will download and processed for you :)  

Each time you make a new POV image, you must first clear out any existing .png files from the pov_tools folder.
If you don't, a message will give you a chance to fix that, then try again.

- Windows: Doubleclick "create_POV_data_files-Win.bat"  
    (If Microsoft Defender pops up a warning, click "More Info" then "Run anyway")  
    Mac or Linux: Doubleclick "create_POV_data_files"
- Choose a height for the resulting image (should probably be the blade length)
- Check the resulting *preview.png, where * is your original filename. It should look windshieldwiper warped.
- The required data files *_POV_data.h have been written to the ProffieOS/styles folder.
- Edit the `#include` line toward the top of ProffieOS/styles/pov.h to be the data file you want to use.
- If you processed a Single Color source file, use the resulting *_SC_POV_data.h file.
- If you processed a Full Color source file, then use the resulting *_FC_POV_data.h file.
- Then you just use the POV blade style in a preset::
```
{ "Font", "tracks/track.wav",
   &style_pov, 
  "my_pov"},
  ```

Swing the blade in a steady movement to see the image in the air. A long-exposure capture showcases the result best.
Enjoy!  (⌐■_■)
